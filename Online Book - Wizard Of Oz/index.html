		<h3 id="intro" class="subtitle">Introduction</h3>
		<p class="indent">Folklore, legends, myths and fairy tales have followed childhood through the ages, for every healthy youngster has a wholesome and instinctive love for stories fantastic, marvelous and manifestly unreal.  The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more happiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.</p>
		<p>Yet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be classed as “historical” in the children’s library; for the time has come for a series of newer “wonder tales” in which the stereotyped genie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible and blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a fearsome moral to each tale.  Modern education includes morality; therefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales and gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.</p>
		<p>Having this thought in mind, the story of “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz” was written solely to please children of today.  It aspires to being a modernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and the heartaches and nightmares are left out. </p>
