		<strong>You are my peach, you are my plum. You are my earth, you are my sun. I love your fingers, I love your toes. The back of your head, the tip of your nose. And you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about. Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about. One day you will find someone who will love you like you deserve. But tonight I'm the only one left and I'm betting it's a fact that you will never learn. Once I sink my teeth, your skin's not so tough. I'll leave a tiny cut, there'll be a lot of blood. But once you wipe it up you will feel better about our entire situation. You are my light, no need to hide. You are my clock, keep me on time. You are my angel, you are my crime. I'll serve this sentence the rest of my life. And you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about. Yeah, you are the reason I'm smiling when there is nothing to smile about. </strong>I do things wrong<strong>, you thought I might. You say I'm gonna miss you when you leave and you are probably right. But I'm just as stoned, I don't wanna fight. You say I should think before I talk, you say I shouldn't think about my life. Cause once I finally hit the ground, who's gonna drag me into the light? It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, woah. It's just so hard to see tomorrow past tonight, woah.</strong>
