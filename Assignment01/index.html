			<p>Let's discuss the Spider-Man movies. I believe that Tobey Maguire was the best Spider-Man. I'm not saying that Andrew Garfield or Tom Holland are bad Spider-Mans (Spider-Men?), but they just did not stay true to the Spider-Man I know and love. Let me take you back to when I was first exposed to Spider-Man. It was 1998, I'm now 4 years old and watching the Kids WB. The <a id="external-link" class="text-link" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112175/" target="_blank">1994 Spider-Man</a> cartoon was shown on Saturday mornings. My best friend, Nick, and I would get up just for that show. It was the highlight of our day. This show had all of the best Spider-Man villians and I think Peter Parker was best portrayed in this show versus others.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Peter was older, maybe in college, and his aunt and uncle were both old folks. For some reason, that all just makes sense. Peter should be older and somewhat more mature, but still very nerdy and not the best looking guy. Maybe even a very average looking guy. He's gotta struggle to get the girl because he's awkward and a nice guy. He is also a photographer for the Daily Bugle. This is what was depicted in the 1994 cartoon and that is also how Tobey Maguire movies are.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The first one does start out with Peter in High School, but it's his senior year. His aunt and uncle are old folks and he's extremely awkward and nerdy. He's perfect. Andrew Garfield is too much of a pretty boy. He's not awkward enough and does not come off as nerdy. He says nerdy things and shows off a bit in that aspect, but just does not fit the part. They got many parts of Spider-man correct, maybe even more correct than the Tobey Maguire movies, but that's not why I'm ranting here. This is only about who plays Spider-man and how Peter Parker is displayed. The newest Spider-man, Tom Holland, did a good job for a young Peter Parker/Spider-man but, like I've been saying, I see Peter Parker as an 20-something-year-old, not a teenager. Also his aunt is way too young. It felt strange having Robert Downey Jr.'s character hitting on aunt May.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Honestly, in comes down to how Spider-man was displayed to me when I was younger. The 1994 cartoon is engrained in my memory as how Spider-man, and even more so Peter Parker, should be. There may be other depictions of Spider-man that are more accurate, like in the comics, which I did not read and definitely wish I did back in the day. This is why I believe Tobey did the best job and those Spider-man movies were the best.</p>
